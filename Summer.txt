Summer Of '69 


. D
 I got my first real six-string
. A
 Bought it at the five-and-dime
. D
 Played it till my fingers bled
. A
 It was the summer of '69


. D
 Me and some guys from school
. A
 Had a band and we tried real hard
. D
 Jimmy quit and Jody got married
. A
 I shoulda known we'd never get far


. Bm         A
 Oh when I look back now
. D					  G
 That summer seemed to last forever
. Bm 		  A
 And if I had the choice
. D 			   G
 Ya I'd always wanna be there
. Bm							  D
 Those were the best days of my life


. D
 Ain't no use in complainin'
. A 
 When you got a job to do
. D
 Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
. A
 And that's when I met you yeah



. Bm				 A
 Standin' on your Mama's porch
. D					   G
 You told me that you'd wait forever
. Bm				A
 Oh and when you held my hand
. D				   G
 I knew that it was now or never
. Bm							  D
 Those were the best days of my life

Back in the summer of '69


. F			Bm
 Man we were killin' time
. 		C
We were young and restless
.     Bm
We needed to unwind
. F		 Bm				  C
 I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no


. D
 And now the times are changin'
. A
 Look at everything that's come and gone
. D
 Sometimes when I play that old six-string
. A
 I think about ya wonder what went wrong


. Bm				 A
 Standin' on your Mama's porch
. D					 G
 You told me it would last forever
. Bm			    A
 Oh the way you held my hand
. D				    G
 I knew that it was now or never
. Bm                               D
 Those were the best days of my life

Back in the summer of '69
