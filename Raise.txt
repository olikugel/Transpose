 			YOU RAISE ME UP


VERSE
.            D        G               D
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;             
.              D      G           A   Asus4     A
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;     
.            Bm        G                 D       G
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,   
.           D      A              D
Until you come and sit awhile with me.              


CHORUS
.             Bm     G                 D            A
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
.              Bm     G              D         A    
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
.         Bm       G                  D     G
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
.             D       A               D
You raise me up to more than I can be.              


VERSE
.		   D         G                D
There is no life - no life without its hunger; 
.               D          G        A  Asus4   A
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly; 
.              Bm      G                 D       G
But when you come and I am filled with wonder, 
.               D       A           D
Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.
