	I WILL RISE (CHRIS TOMLIN)


VERSE
. F#m                              D
There's a peace I've come to know
. A                                E
Though my heart and flesh may fail
. F#m                          D
There's an anchor for my soul
. A                    E
I can say "It is well"

. A                E
Jesus has overcome
. F#m                         D
And the grave is overwhelmed
. A                E
The victory is won
. F#m                      D
He is risen from the dead



CHORUS
. A                                   E
And I will rise when He calls my name
. F#m                         D
No more sorrow, no more pain
. A                          E
I will rise on eagles' wings
. F#m                           D
Before my God fall on my knees
. A      D
And rise
. A         E
I will rise



VERSE
. F#m                              D
There's a day that's drawing near
. A                                E
When this darkness breaks to light
. F#m                      D
And the shadows disappear
. A                           E
And my faith shall be my eyes

. A                E
Jesus has overcome
. F#m                         D
And the grave is overwhelmed
. A                E
The victory is won
. F#m                      D
He is risen from the dead



CHORUS
. A                                   E
And I will rise when He calls my name
. F#m                         D
No more sorrow, no more pain
. A                          E
I will rise on eagles' wings
. F#m                           D
Before my God fall on my knees
. A      D
And rise
. A         E
I will rise



BRIDGE 2X
. E                D        A     E       
And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
. D       A         E
"Worthy is the Lamb"
. E               D       A      E
And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
. D       A         E
"Worthy is the Lamb"



CHORUS
. A                                   E
And I will rise when He calls my name
. F#m                         D
No more sorrow, no more pain
. A                          E
I will rise on eagles' wings
. F#m                           D
Before my God fall on my knees
. A      D
And rise
. A         E
I will rise
